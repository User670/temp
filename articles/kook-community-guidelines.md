# KOOK Community Guideline
The goal of KOOK is to create a platform for communication that is centered around gamers, and to make it easy and fun to "play games with people". We hope that people follow these important rules as you participate the chats. This would be the intention and goal of the Community Guideline.

## We FORBID:
- mentioning anything prohibited by law. Laws still apply on the internet.
- discussing any topic related to politics.
- spreading rumors or other information that disrupts social order or undermines social stability.
- spreading NSFW content like pronography or violence. (Important!)

Violating above rules and your account will be BANNED, and you might also face legal consequences.

*(Translator's note: for more detailed rules on what will cause KOOK to ban your account, please read the* KOOK's Statement on Punishing Rule Violations *.)*

In order to better maintain the atmosphere of the community, we also expect everyone to follow the Behavioral Guidelines and Content Guidelines as outlned below:

## Behavioral Guideline that we expect you to follow
- Do not organize, participate in, or encourage others to participate in harassment. It is normal to have disagreements, but continious, repeated or severe negative remarks might cause harassment. This is forbidden.
- Do not organize, promote or attack servers based on hate speech *(Translator's note: discrimination)*. It is not acceptable to attack a person or a community based on race, ethnicity, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, religion or disability.
- Do not threat other people with violence or harm. This includes indirect harm. This includes publishing, or threat to publish, personal information of people.
- Do not evade blacklists and server bans. Do not send unnecessary or repeated friend requests or DMs, especially after them explicitly expressing that they are unwilling to communicate with you. Do not try to contact someone who blocked you by hiding your identity, or any other ways that bypasses self-protection tools of other people.
- Do not send virus or malware. Do not attempt to trick people. Do not hack or perform DDoS attack.

## Content Guideline that we expect you to follow
- Do not post any content that glorifies self-harm or suicide. Do not encourage self-harm.
- Do not post images of abuse of human or animals.
- Do not promote, distribute or provide content related to obtaining, cracking/hacking or distributing pirated software or pirated accounts. This also includes sharing or selling cheats and hacks that might negatively impact other players in multiplayer ga mes *[sic]*.
- Do not use the servers to perform any activities related to law violations and crimes. This includes, but does not limit to, pyramid scheme, scams and financial crimes. We will report illegal behaviors to law enforcement.
