## "I'm somehow trapped in this game."
> Intern editor Yuan Weiteng

Flore lost again.

Maybe "lose" isn't the right word. Normally winning and losing comes from competition, you can only lose if someone wins. Flore isn't playing with anyone. No one points a gun at him, no character dies, no warp to home, and no cutscene of the base being destroyed. So maybe this isn't a lose.

But Flore still thinks he lost. What he's playing is Tetris - many versions of them. Blocks stack on top of each other and arrange in lines, players control the falling blocks, clear, and score. In these games, Flore experienced unprecedented sense of failure. The reason of failure is speed. In other words, he's not fast enough.

For a regular person, Tetris can't be simpler. Stack, clear, keep the blocks away from the ceiling. But to Flore, Tetris is a race, and it needs speed, concentration, power, and precision. The rules are simple: clear 40 lines as fast as possible. Flore's personal record is 27.432 seconds, which means he drops 3.5 pieces each second, and clear 1.5 lines.

In China Mainland, there are 22 people ahead of him.

Flore's "lose" is relative.

There are footage of his Sprint games. To a regular player, the pieces in the videos fall at blazing speed, like raindrop, and turn into two delicate and dense peaks, with a valley in the middle - Sprint runners like to split the stack in two, build on the sides, leave a one-wide gap in the middle, and fill the gap in after accumulating some blocks and make a swift clear. The visuals of the line clear reach the brain faster than the sound effect, and the effect is immediately followed by another visual. It goes on and on, like the lightning in a thunderstorm.

When a normal person sees his gameplay, the first reaction is usually "You can play Tetris like that?" To most people, Tetris is but a "puzzle game" on those old TV sets. This kind of idea is sometimes full of bias, and see its side that is casual and not hardcore. To put it harshly, to many people, Tetris is a game for kids.

Regardless of what others view it, Flore values the result more than the process. Losing is losing, which is being slower than other people. In a speedy game of Tetris, the game tracks the time of each game in seconds, and accurate to 3 decimal places. Winning and losing is a simple result, there no room for debate.

Flore often feels anxious. In real life, he is a calm and easy going person, and his "most important value" is to respect other people's feelings. His friends think that he is "nice" and "caring". But when it comes to Tetris, he becomes totally different. He curses when he loses, he curses when he's doing bad. He always has lots of strong language and has to vent them out.

He knows a few foreign languages. If the games are too bad and goes over-the-top angry, he starts to curse in languages that other people don't understand. There is also a difference in what language he uses. He most commonly uses French, which is fluent in, and is easy for him to use. Other languages are less fluent, and the only purpose of them is to swear. I asked him why swear with a foreign language. He answered, "I don't want to ruin other people's mood with my F words".

Actually he doesn't curse other people, he only curses himself. In games he's never angry at other people, but he is strict with himself. His social media bio reads "Why flore so weak" - and it's not quite enough, so he copy pasted this until the character limit - 7 times.

The time when it was worst was the time when it was the closest to success. Two months ago, Flore slumped in a chair and posted in his social media: "I'm not angry. I'm not angry at all. I'm very calm, there isn't a single wave in my heart." He emphasized, he is "really, really, really [not angry]". Below the text is a screenshot, with two stacks of blocks, 4 layers tall, and a vertical long bar nearly managed to clear it. The counter says it's the last 4 lines, with timer at 0:30.683, and should it not have gone wrong, it would have broke his personal record by nearly 1 second.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/720c5b8c84b383d45730ca74708763f19fc6e6eb.jpg@942w_618h_progressive.webp)
<br />*("ps. my PB is 31.613 seconds")*

What does one second mean to him? Flore made a line graph, not only to keep track of his records but also to urge him practice. The y axis is time. Since January 2021, he makes progress about every half a month, sometimes by 0.7 second, sometimes by merely 0.1 second. The process of cutting down the time is like a worm eating tree leaves: the large chunks are gone, leaving the veins to tackle. Only rarely - once in the past year - can he make a progress of over 1 second.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/2f714bd03e306801d13fd8eb1ccd2908d7e8c3a0.jpg@942w_689h_progressive.webp)

The chance was golden, but he messed up. Murphy's law is real - you always get what you don't want. It's just that one block, but it was nonetheless dropped to the side, stuck there on the top of the foundation, making the already-tall stack taller, like a skinny old man idly staring at the gap below. Flore slams on the pause button, and lost all his strength. He slumped into his chair. His mind was blank.

He's shocked. Like being struck by a lightning. "My head was empty. Somehow I didn't feel that much pity, just lying in my bed, lying for the rest of the day, didn't do anything else." He knows it's just one record, and he would sooner or later get there again. Whether it's the pity of a mistake or the pride of success, it would always be overtaken and be buried in history. He knows all the logic, but still feels bad.

Because no one will know whether your improvement will be the last one. Tetris speed players all know that your score doesn't necessarily improve with your practice. Just like any skill, gaming skills also have a plateau. Many people get better really fast at the beginning, and then some day get stuck at somewhere and unable to surpass the past record. They call it the "ceiling". It's like an invisible wall. They practice, they advance, until one they hit the wall and unable to move further.

Flore knows this. His training is intense. He trains for two whole hours each day, or when he's really into it, he might go on for 7 or 8 hours, until the fingers hurt. Sprint requires you to make no mistake while going at full speed. Clearing 40 lines need at least 100 pieces, and one is bound to make a mistake with such a number. Mistakes, however, are fine, just restart the game, over and over again, until you reach a valid score. Usually one game is just 30 seconds for him, but only a handful of games will reach the end for the whole day worth of practice.

Repetitive, boring and useless grinding started to slowly grind off the spirits of the players. Flore sometimes cries too. The strongest emotional breakdown was in August this year, when his own time didn't improve for a long time, but two friends who mainly play battle just "casually broke records". At 4 pm, one of them broke his record by one second, and at 6 pm, the other friend got it too, also with admirable improvements.

Battle is another mode of Tetris. You might have heard of *Tetris 99*. Some people call it "Tetris battle royale", but the community often calls it "T99". A common misunderstanding is that Tetris is a single player game, but it couldn't be more wrong. "T99", for instance, is an online battle game. In the game, 99 players play against each other, sending their cleared lines to opponents' fields under certain rules. Faster players clear more and send more attack, while slower players get eliminated one by one; the last surviving player wins. It's also fun to play.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/d6090c3f891504431c02a862d57226e69d61971e.jpg@942w_531h_progressive.webp)
<br />*(A 99-player battle royale.)*

Online battle modes aren't originated from T99. Similar battle modes have always been a main mode of Tetris games. Of course, more players are familiar with 1v1 battle or with a small group of people, instead of a 99-player battle royale, though the rules are largely the same.

Compared to Sprint, the main mode is actually Battle. The PvP combats bring a lot of fun. If we say Sprint is like a boring grind in the gym, then battle is like a friendly game on the field. Even though both modes are Tetris, the two sides are completely different. Sprint only calls for speed, but battle calls for striking the hardest when the opponent is the weakest. Battle's attack system prefers combos, spins and Tetrises, thus have very different strategies from Sprint. When you play different modes, you would also naturally train in different directions.

Thus, Flore cannot accept the records of his friends. Not like he doesn't hope his friends do well, but why, despite all his hard work, can't even compare with the casual lunch break game of someone else? He completely fell into this thought. He saw his own failure from others' achievement - or sometimes not even quite "achievement".

Flore broke down. He cried out loud, in a small groupchat with a handful of players. He sends out the voice messages, with words and cries and sobs blended together, one message after another, without even caring about other people's reactions. This isn't common at all, but his friends don't feel strange. Rather than surprise, they showed their acceptance, responding to an out-of-control emotion with the most appropriate approach. They all understand the situation well. They reply to Flore one by one.

"What did they say back then?" I asked him.

"I'm fine. It's the past, and I don't want to look back for now." His tone lowered.

... ...

"Am I not being polite?" He asked me with a bit hesitation.

"How come?"

"You know, like, ... jealous. Like the seven sins."

The Tetris community in China isn't big. It's not us being modest about it; the community worldwide isn't big either. In China, almost all active players know almost all other active players - if you mention one to another, they can often tell you a bit about how good and how active they are.

"Community" here practically means specifically QQ group chats. Chinese Tetris players are mostly within a dozen or so groups, with 100 to 3000 members in each one, and around 5000 total if you account for duplicates. To them, Tetris is simply "fun", and because of this, "having fun" is more important than winning.

On May 28th, 2010, an 8th grader created what eventually became the biggest Tetris community in China. The initial goal of the groupchat was simple, or you might even say casual - to make a Tetris game that "has the best handling by my standards". The game was made wih Visual Basic 6, which he learned from a classmate in grade 4. The classmate also played Tetris and learned programming from a book, he then learned from the classmate. He wasn't good at it, but after some fiddling around, he eventually made a working game.

He created the groupchat, simply named "Tetris Research". "After all it's for collecting feedback for the game, so the name is quite programmer-ish." He also came up with a weird nickname: "Farter". His game attracted many Tetris players, and through the word of mouth, all Tetris players in China eventually knew about this weird name. Calling a person "fart" still isn't the most appropriate, so people added a title, and started calling him "Uncle Farter".

"Making a perfect Tetris game" is a goal shared by more than just one person, and many player have plans to make their own Tetris game. Speaking of a fan-made game, many community members might think of another game - *Techmino*, by MrZ, a college junior.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/bb73382a8b277ccd0312615a8d339cfc28d9d4ac.jpg@942w_437h_progressive.webp) <br />*(Main menu of Techmino.)*

What is special about this game? MrZ explained that Tetris game are roughly divided into two categories, "delay Tetris" and "delayless Tetris". The delay doesn't refer to input delay in the usual sense, but the delay between two actions. A way to measure said delay is by Delayed Auto Shift (DAS for short). When you hold a direction key, the block will stop for a while after moving one block, then continue moving at a constant speed.

It sounds like a bit abstract. When explaining this concept, MrZ told me to change my input method to Chinese *([sic]. TL: I think they mean English)*, then hold the "A" key. I followed, and a string of letter "a" appeared in the text box.

"See? There is a pause between the first and second letters appearing. Tetris is the same, and two movements have a pause in between, which we call delay."

"The other type of delay is line delay." He continued. Line delay is the delay after the player clears a line, including the animation for the clearing as well as for the blocks above to fall down. It's a short delay, usually counted in milliseconds, but has a significant impact on how the game feels. Let's just take Sprint: clear 40 lines, and each line clear has 400ms delay, in the most extreme case it can add up to 16 seconds, while the delayless Sprint world record is even less than 15 seconds. There is such a difference so that players always compete within one rule set; you can't compare across rule sets.

If a game has delays, players call it "delay Tetris", otherwise they call it "delayless Tetris". The former is less popular than the latter.

Tetris has mostly set rules, so when one wants to make a better game, what they work on is in the details and fine tuning. Those games that have an official Tetris license almost employed the same set of standards, and the more popular ones mostly have delays, which Chinese players don't like. MrZ wants every player to find it comfortable to play, so he just made most important parameters manually adjustable. To him, softwares are just like hardwares, with no hard standards of good or bad; it's good as long as you are comfortable with it.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/70a288890682ebcc620a57468eed4018106998a0.jpg@942w_437h_progressive.webp) <br />*(Some adjustable parameters in the game.)*

*Techmino* is very well known in the Tetris community. MrZ has created dedicated groupchats for this game. Players are very active in the groups; now there are 2 QQ groups with nearly 3000 members in total, and a Discord server with over 500 international players. In real life, MrZ is a college student who will graduate next year, and it's time for him to consider about his future. He majors in computers *(TL: original text just says "computers", my guess is computer science)*, with little to do with game design. His mother wants him to go to graduate school, for graduate students have more advantage in the saturating job market. MrZ isn't exactly a fan of that idea.

"It would be nice if I could combine my job and my hobby." MrZ has considered going down the game dev path, but is also concerned that he doesn't have peoper training and lack the needed skills. After all, "there are people out there who do very well but still don't earn enough bucks", and it can only go worse for a hobbist like him.

However, as far as I'm aware, if you ever ask a Tetris player what Tetris game to play on mobile, in most cases they would recommend *Techmino*, and there is hardly any other game better than that. A common tag line in the community is "Techmino is fun" - it is indeed fun, and it's liked by many people, what it needs is a bit of approval of the market.

"The bigger I make it and the more directions it expands to, the more I realize I hardly know anything. How scary." MrZ told me with the typical kind of mental state of the students of his age, "but I don't quite want to do those things I don't find fun, right?"

You might have heard of a person called "Amemiya Taiyou". He is the most popular Tetris live streamer in Japan, with quite a bit popularity in China as well. He also has an exclusive title, "the God of Tetris". But to be honest, this title is more of a bluff than anything else. The Tetris scene is ever-changing, and the "God" of today might be just second or third place of tomorrow - in other words, Amemiya Taiyou is but a common person, and his skills isn't the best.

There are three top Tetris players in Japan. Based off the occasional few battles between them, the other two playrs have a significant advantage against Amemiya Taiyou. If we are just talking about pure skills, the "God" title is indeed not exactly appropriate for Amemiya Taiyou. But real life is never this rigorous. While skills are still vital, other factors like promotion, marketing and exposure all significantly affect the popularity of a player; on the other hand, fans find it hard to rank the players based on skill, because Amemiya Taiyou rarely battles those that he has once lost to, whether it's intentional or not. Once he loses to a player, he never plays against him again.

That is also why Amemiya Taiyou doesn't have exactly the best reputation in the community. Players admit that he is skilled, but also wonder "why does he do that". It's not decent of him to be strong but still plays little tricks like that. Though regardless of what some people think of him, he is still the most famous Tetris live streamer for those outside of the community.

Many things in life is just like that - some people's trash is other people's treasure, what one doesn't care about might be picked up and loved by some other people. From a secular point of view, those who are rich in the mind might not be the best off in material. So with what standard should we judge one's life? For what it's worth, spiritual life might be more important. So their spiritual life is richer? Maybe.

Amemiya Taiyou is the only streamer who can "make a living out of playing Tetris". When he plays Tetris, he needs to focus - the harder the battle, the less room there is for the streamer to talk. Amemiya's strategy for that is to add filler words, like "Wait!", "Ola!" and "Hoi!". Many other players don't play any worse, and also have live streams, but they don't get as much income. Diao is 17 years old, high school student, from Malaysia, speaks English and Chinese, and is one of the top 4 players in delayless Tetris. In the self introductions he gave me, he wrote "My efficiency is higher than anyone in the world", and then striked it out. On his Twitch dashboard, it shows that he earned US$ 17.65 from streaming in the past two months.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/fba8860e2fc6690fcef85e40123899bf7a3fe3b2.jpg@942w_492h_progressive.webp) <br />*(Diao's stream stats)*

Diao is a strong player, and is admired by players in the community. Soon after I joined the groupchats and said I'd like to interview some players, almost everyone started to half-jokingly spam "I want to see an interview of Diao", and can hardly see any other messages. Two years ago, a Malaysian Chinese invited Diao into the Chinese Tetris community by chance, and soon after, he got quite well within the community.

Diao has won world champions many times. "The best" isn't just words from other players: each player's skills have solid evidence to support. *Tetr.io* is the most popular game among delayless Tetris players. The second place on the leaderboard is called ZOIMAOAH, with 92.78% win rate, higher than most people, including the first place. The only reason it isn't on the first place is that it didn't play that much. This account is Diao's - the game forbids alts but doesn't restrict name changes, so he changes his nickname every once in a while.

ZOIMAOAH is actually the name of another player. That player is a friend of Diao's, and one day they decided to swap nicknames. Another friend of Diao told me that Diao likes to do these weird and funny things. Once he registered a new account and used that account to play in a tournament. He played against another strong player, and had a tight fight. The commentator didn't realize who this "new" player was, and at last thought it was another Japanese player who also often changes nicknames. After the victory, Diao left a "Who is diao?" in the chat, and left.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/bac932e3b93a1f74f9f950f1aec7009ae6b74828.jpg@942w_530h_progressive.webp) <br />*(Diao as Majimedewanai, a "Japanese" player. Seems like the commentator mistook him for someone else, and wrote "Probably Ajanba" in the player bio.)*

He also once used the nickname "cztoxicgamergirl". The "CZ" is of course not a girl. Diao often play together with CZ, and they often make jokes of each other. CZ isn't sure why Diao does that, maybe just for "fun". Many other players also like to use other people's names in their nickname, like how kids have nicknames of other kids, pull of a prank and have some stupid fun.

During the interview, Diao sent me this self introduction:

> My name is Diao. I'm 17 years old. My house is in Kuala Lumpur, Peninsular Malaysia, and I am not married. I do homework at home, and I go to bed every day by 3 AM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink cola. I'm in bed at 5:30 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm Milo (chocolate milk) and doing about one hour of chatting before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
> <br />--Diao, Tetris player

The language seem a bit weird, as if coming from someone who is not fluent in Chinese. It was only later that I realize it's from "Jojo's Bizzare Adventure", more specifically, the self introduction of Yoshikage Kira, the "master of broken hands" in the show, a villain who is evil yet charming. I was suddenly reminded of the Joker in DC Comics. Back when I was in high school, I used to be a big fan of Joker. I thought he's indulgent, a bit crazy, but yet thoughtful. He's cool.

> My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
> <br />--Yoshikage Kira, *Jojo's Bizzare Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable*

"Modian T283" (Wu Songhao) is another popular player in the community. In 2016, a TV show of Jiangsu TV invited the best Japanese Tetris player, Hirozumi Kibi (hebo_mai), and was needing a player for a "China vs Japan match". The directors of the show reached out to the community and asked for volunteers. Not many people responded, but Modian volunteered. Back then he wasn't exactly good at battle or sprint, but he was good at playing invisible Tetris. It's a special game mode where blocks go invisible after landing, with the board be pitch black, and it all relies on memory to figure out where to put the blocks.

The directors considered invisible Tetris be good on on the show, for it requires both hand-eye coordination and good memory. Near the end of the show, a few judges graded the difficulty of the challenge. Three judges each score it on a scale from 1 to 5, and Modian got the full point of 15. For the purpose of the show, the production team marketed Modian as a "master of games", "beating Mario at 3 years old, Adventure Island at 4 years old, Battle City at 5 years old within a week". In the studio, every time he clears an invisible line, the audience burst into cheers.

That year, Hirozumi Kibi was undoubtedly the best player in the world. He got three world champions in official tournaments, and was dubbed "the greatest of all time" by the western community. While he isn't the best with invisible or sprint, but he is still among the top ones. Should Modian play sprint or battle against Hirozumi Kibi, the chance of winning is slim. But invisible Tetris is different. Invisible Tetris calls for practice and familiarity, and he has quite the chance of winning. However, during the actual match, the production team has set up different keyboards from the ones used in rehersal, which has quite the different feel. Together with some bad decisions in the game, Modian lost the match.

After the show, viewers started to talk about it online. Who of the two was stronger? Did the Chinese really lose to the Japanese? Can the "master of games" represent the best standards in China? While some doubted, others showed disdain towards the performance. The internet is just like this, everyone can talk about some public figures. For the common people, if you did something bad, you get at most a few hate comments, you fight them off with your keyboard, it was no big deal. For public figures it's different. They are the focus of the public opinions. While one might win an argument against a few people, you can't win against such a large population. The best response is to not respond at all, but when you are under attack by thousands of people, you would definitely feel bad.

Have you considered this: when a person was put under the spotlight as a genius, what does he gain? And what does he lose? After the show, Modian got a bit of popularity for a while, and another show invited him. At the studio, the show's team recorded him playing Tetris on a PSP, from beginning to end. He doesn't seem to care about other people talking or competing, only talking when the host asks him questions, and never lifting his eyes off the device. When it's his turn to step onto the stage, colorful Tetris pieces were displayed onto the screen, and the audience were amazed by the invisible blocks being cleared, and the piece of his mind that is finally shown to other people.

Last year, Jilin Television invited him to another show. Also a variety show, also shows him playing Tetris, also invisible. They didn't even change the slogan - "beating Mario at age 3, Adventure Island at 4, Tanks at 5"; "the best master of games".

Modian later got a job at a cyber cafe as a counter clerk. Literally a clerk, the kind that collects fees and swipes ID cards. The reason for this job choice is simple, "the job as a clerk is not too busy and I get time to play games". Two months later, he left this job, and got to participate in recording sessions of another show. After the show, he joined a power plant as a maintenance crew that fixes whoever's broken computer at the site. The job is "a bit more busy", but it's a state-owned company, so the job is more stable, so still not bad.

After the show gets more popular, some media started covering him. Some reporters saw that the "master of games" started doing "ordinary jobs", and wrote a story of "how a genius falls", and wrote down the job position as "security guard" in the title. Modian was angry after seeing it, saying that the media was "writing bullshit and have no bottom line".

One more year later, he left his job and went to Shenzhen. This time he had no plans, and "had no thoughts". In his words, it's more like a whim - being bored in a small town, he wanted to try exploring in a big city. He didn't find a suitable job yet. He rented a small room with his savings. He sleeps plenty, and stream him playing games when he's awake. He mainly plays Tetris and League of Legends. He doesn't have many followers and can't earn much money, but at least it's free and happy for him.

I asked if he had any plans for the future. He said no. What about job preference? He said, "something not so busy, and related to games."

I then asked what his ideal life looks like.

He thought for a while. "Just like now."

I also talked with many more people. The Tetris community is not so big, but there are all kinds of people in there. I've covered some of them, and more that I've yet to cover - like Zouzhizhang, who trains AIs that play Tetris. He calls those AIs "bots", and the bots are undefeated against any other players (and likely will remain undefeated). Hands and brains made of flesh can't compare with machines. The bots can adjust their play style based on some parameters; they can be aggressive and they can be conservative too. He also trains bots against each other, eventually reaching a most efficient strategy for the bots.

Zouzhizhang told me that bots are good at sending large spikes, thus the bionics algorithms chose a strategy that are mainly defensive with constant outputs, first keep survival, and then knock out the opponent with big bursts of combos.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/d6e78eaa4db4e1cea76552c4531462fbb138979b.jpg@942w_512h_progressive.webp) <br />*(Diao vs bot by Zouzhizhang. The bots have their speed capped, otherwise it's unplayable. Players often practice with bots; by adjusting the speed of the bots, they can be very good training partners.)*

Also Tianyi. Tianyi is a college sophomore, a young one in the community. Some people may expect the Tetris community to be mostly people for their nostalgia, but the reality is the opposite; players in the community are mostly students. College students are more common, and there are also quite a number of middle school or high school students. When trying to interview him, it's common that I send him a message in the day, and only get a reply in the evening, followed by an apology of "sorry, was having class in the afternoon".

Tianyi started playing Tetris since he was small - he first played Tetris when he was 5 years old. After thousands of hours of practice, he became one of the best players in China when he was in middle school. His classmates were not aware of this, and he rarely talked about it; occationally when his friends see him playing games, they just scream "wow that's awesome" and then leave very soon. He wanted to invite other people to play with him, but rarely does anyone show any interest.

Also Mifu. While Tetris puts a lot of focus on speed, King of Stackers is the exact opposite, and players call it a "turn-based Tetris game". Usually Tetris follows a "bag-7" rule, i.e. 7 pieces appear in a bundle with no duplicates. In King of Stackers, two players don't play at the same time, and they instead play in turns of 7 pieces - a player places a bag of pieces, and wait for the other player to place their bag. You can't move before they finish playing, thus "turn-based".

A regular game of battle Tetris is fast paced and players can't think of every possible move, but in King of Stackers, you even have to consider the strategies of the opponent. The core of the game is at finding the optimal solution. Players can reset as much as they want before submitting their moves, and they have to find the optimal way to place blocks in continuous trial and error. The back and forth is more like playing chess. The thinking of one turn can easily take over an hour, and it's common to have a single match last over 30 hours. Mifu told me that this mode is very fun to play, and he once was in the top 10 in the global leaderboards.

Everyone in the groupchat plays Tetris, with intense sessions, almost playing every day, two or three hours at a time, or even more. Some have played for a year or two, some played for over a decade. Some see Tetris as a game, some see it as the most important thing in their life. Everyone is different here. So I asked everyone a question: What does Tetris mean to you?

Diao said: "Tetris = procrastination. When I don't want to do homework I play Tetris, when I don't want to play Tetris I do homework."

Modian T283 said: "I don't make comments on this. Whatever one thinks is what he thinks."

Farter said; "I'm not much of a social person, but it's natural for me to start a conversation with a stranger from Tetris."

MrZ said: "Can't think of much all of a sudden. I just feel happy. It's good."

Mifu said: "Good game. Nothing special, it's fun to play, so I play it."

Tianyi said: "Fun indeed. At the beginning I also thought of becoming stronger, but perhaps because I'm already a good player, I no longer think of that."

Zouzhizhang (who now works in the field of data storage and databases) said: "I made bots to help players practice, or for players to see new things. Algorithms can come up with what humans can't think of."

Teatube (community manager, tournament host) said: "Perhaps the best I can do is to gather the people together."

Kui (one of the best players in Mainland, student of Tsinghua University, female) said: "Because it's fun." *(Translator's note: Tsinghua is one of the top universities in China.)*

Xiaowuyin (formerly known as Youran, top 5 in Mainland in delay Tetris, kinda-on-a-Tetris-break) said: "I never found anyone to play Tetris with me IRL. It's the time and happiness that I can't get back."

Mars (one of the best players of delay Tetris in Mainland, used to work in government, now works in research. 32 years old) said: "The most important reason is of course fun. Also it's like a platform for me to communicate with people that are like, higher up in social status. Ordinarily Tsinghua students are like on a whole another level from me. Nothing does better than video games when it comes to bringing people of different social classes or otherwise separated people together."

Flore's nickname comes from Florentino Ariza, a character in the novel *Love in the Time of Cholera*. The original name was too long so he took the first bit. Florentino in the novel is a playboy who dated 623 girls but only loves one. For the one he loves, he would wait for 53 years. The life of a man might only have one period of 53 years. Florentino is a playboy but yet also dedicated with love; he loved a thousand women but only loves one. The one he "thought was the most romantic".

Flore didn't get a girl he loved in high school. After reading the novel, he quietly changed the nickname to the name of the hero of the novel. As time flies, one's mind changes too; his love of youth is no more, but the name that he liked remained.

He told me that the name "Flore" is quite nice. Even if it's just a combination of letters, it looks round, smooth and lovely. Like a flower.

By the time the interview ended, Flore was still training. To help ease his mind, he hardly plays battle, and he wouldn't get too angry even if his daily hours of training don't go so well. Earlier, *Tetris Effect: Connected* was released on Steam. The game has great graphics and music, like a piece of art, and attracted basically everyone in the community. Flore had fun with it too, and got a decent position on the leaderboards. Sometimes he wants to try again and go for a better score. Sometimes he gets there, sometimes he doesn't. But unlike before, he wouldn't mind even he doesn't quite make it, and leave it when it's about enough. Life has to continue.

Back in the days when he was way too into the game, he had a goal for himself to beat a player that he has never beaten before. The two player arranged a match, with the "FT15" rule, whoever gets 15 wins first wins the game. The game started smoothly. Flore was in good condition, decent speed, hardly misdropped, and got a score of 14 to 11, taking the match point.

Victory is just barely within reach. "Just one more game!" One game! Just one more, and the practice of the past months would pay off. But things don't always go as we wish. His mind was a mess, and his hands were out of control, making many mistakes in a row. The more mistakes he made, the more anxious he got. The lead was soon levelled out. Seeing the opponent catching up with the scores, he was very worried; he tried to calm down but it didn't help, and he did even worse. He eventually lost the last game. After he closed the game, he cried, and he never had another match with that player, because whenever he opens the game, he thinks of that failure. "I can never defeat him." He doesn't like this thought, but it doesn't go away.

"It's like building a tower with wood blocks. When you know you can carry on with it, and keep building for decades, you'll feel enormous joy with the task." He uses building a tower as a metaphor for persistence in doing something, "but the tower has a mind of its own, and it may decide to collapse one day on its own."

"For some reason I an trapped in this game." Flore has strong feelings of this quote. He said, "wonderfully said, that's what we are." Tetris does indeed bring joy, but the process is also painful at times. In the end, it's hard to tell whether there is more joy or more pain.

"I guess there is more joy."

So what is the happiest thing in his life? Flore thought about this for a long time. Finally, he said something unrelated to Tetris: the year before last, in order to lose weight, he had strict plans, eating light food, and jog every day, aiming to lose 10 kilograms within 4 months. Then he gave himself a mission: he would finish a half marathon within half a year.

Half of a marathon is 21 kilometers, or 52 and a half laps on a 400m track in the school. 85 days later, he stands on the track, preparing for the run. Compared to the road, he prefers running on a flat field. The conditions of the road can be complex, with slopes, cars, other people, all of which can interrupt the flow of the run. The track is different; it's simple and flat, and nothing is more simple than that in life. He stands there, thinking of nothing, blanking out his head. Breath in, breath out, and go.

That day was Sunday, November 17th. On the same morning, Shanghai Marathon was taking place in the Bund. The event has no half marathon, and he can't run a full marathon, so he runs on his own on the track. He purposefully picked this same day, as if it was a ritual. There are many people running on the same tracks, but no one noticed that he ran laps after laps, like a machine spewing out hot steam, never stopping.

It was a cool autumn evening, and the moon was clearly visible in the sky. When he gets bored running, he looks up at the sky. He walks to the exit after his run, soaked in his sweat. He walked into a supermarket, got himself a bottle of milk tea and a bag of whole wheat bread. He hasn't had any sugary drinks for months, and he decided to treat himself with it. The autumn wind is cool, but he feels warm from running. His arms feel powerless from the swinging, but still feels nice. He sat on the bench with joy, taking out his phone to see the stats. Every kilometer took him 4m 50s, with total time just over 1h 40m. It was unexpectedly good, and he was satisfied.

He wrote a social media post for celebration. He sent it. He took out the bread and the drink, looked at the screen, waiting for likes coming in.
