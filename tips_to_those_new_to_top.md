This is what ZZZ - a bot developer who has left the groupchat - once said to me, and I think it was spot on.

These days there are some new players getting started with Tetris, some of them came out of interest, some attracted to the community by Kagura Mea and wish to defeat her. *(TL: Kagura Mea is a VTuber who used to play Tetris on stream. These streams attracted many players to start playing Tetris, at least in China.)* As someone who has been playing for a few years, I feel happy and glad to see this, for the modern Tetris commmunity has never been this popular ever since I started playing. However, as far as I can see, many new players are too eager to make progress. So I'd like to share some of my experience for everyone to take note of.

## 1. If you don't have sub-minute Sprint, you'd better not touch T-Spin. That's an advanced move.
Many new players might have seen the many T-Spin tutorials reposted by [Kitsune](https://space.bilibili.com/10094752), much of the explanations are easy to understand, with accurate Chinese subtitles. However, if you aren't familiar with stacking or can even stack yourself to death, then starting to learn T-Spins is like **learning to run before you can even walk**. Normally one would take quite some time to learn the shapes of each piece and what kind of terrain they can fit in (unless you are a natural, damn they are good); but if you haven't got the basics learned and practiced to fluency, I think getting to T-Spins is not at all beneficial for your improvement.

... I admit T-Spins are cool, but **if you are just clueless just after a T-Spin opener, I think you'd be better off going back to the namesake of the game and clear Tetrises (4 lines with a long bar)**.

## 2. Make sure to dig (defense), attack after you ensure safety, don't be too aggressive
I guess I'm not doing good on this part myself... In many cases when playing battle, I'm stilling greedy for attacks while having a very tall stack, and then I'm dead. As for how you should dig, there are some tutorials in the group chat, ~~and I'll consider playing a few games with pure digging and record it~~

Anyways, don't learn from me when it comes to defence. You can watch footages of bots, or some footage in the game Cultris 2, because in Cultris 2 it demands **much more** skills in digging than on TOP. I also recommend digging straight into Cultris 2; practice of 1-next no-bag-7 digging can be of great help for you when you go back to TOP.

Bots are very strict when it comes to T-Spin Triples. If there is a T piece close in the next queue, a bot would only consider building a TST setup when the stack is below half-screen (10 lines) with less than 2 lines in the garbage buffer, else it might break the setup down. This is something you can learn. Many good players hardly make TST in close battles, and after all TSTs are more like icing on an (already good) cake.

> Think about it. If you focus on attacking, it might make your stats look preetier, but survival is the main goal. You might lose on the chance for many fancy attacks, but if you live, you win. Many people have a single-game stats that tops the bots, but often they can't beat the bots in combat. --bot developers

## 3. Openers are risky, you'll need to be familiar with it if you want to use it
I don't recommend new players to memorize openers, with the same reason as why I don't recommend them do T-Spins. Also if you screw up an opener, you tend to make a mess of your stack; plus new players are weak in digging, and they don't exactly have the best mentality and can easily panic, causing a feedback loop and top themselves out; heck there are even those who suicide before they manage to get anything resembling an opener. I reckon if that's the case, you'd rather give up messes and go with just Tetrises and digging; sometimes being simple gives pretty good results. If you don't trust me, you can try **a game without T-Spins and other fancy attacks, and focus on Tetrises and digging** (also keep in mind 2. above and **don't forget digging**), it won't be that bad, and it will be casual and simple. This playstyle is very good for new players and you can also practice the basics of stacking too, just less cool than T-Spins.

That's all for my first long post about this, with a lot of my thoughts mixed in. I might be less talented with my words or ideas, please give suggestions.
